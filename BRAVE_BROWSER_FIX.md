# Brave Browser Wallet Extension Fix

## Problem

Your application was experiencing navigation issues when users logged in using Brave browser with MetaMask or other wallet extensions. The wallet extensions were interfering with the authentication flow and page navigation.

## Root Causes

1. **Mixed Navigation Methods**: The login page was using `window.location.href` while other parts used Next.js `router.push()`
2. **Wallet Extension Interference**: Brave's built-in wallet extensions intercept and block certain types of navigation requests
3. **Error Code 4001**: MetaMask-specific error for "User rejected the request" when wallet extensions interfere

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Unified Navigation System

- Replaced `window.location.href` with Next.js `router.push()` for consistency
- Created a `safeNavigate()` utility function with multiple fallback methods
- Added proper error handling for navigation failures

### 2. Browser Detection and User Feedback

- Added `isBraveBrowser()` utility to detect Brave browser
- Added `hasWalletExtensions()` utility to detect wallet extensions
- Created `BraveBrowserNotice` component to inform users about potential issues
- Added browser-specific advice in the login page

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Improved error detection for wallet extension interference
- Added specific error messages for Brave browser users
- Enhanced error codes detection (4001, wallet-related messages)

### 4. Security Headers

- Added security headers in `next.config.mjs` to prevent interference
- Added meta tags to help with browser compatibility

## Files Modified

### Core Changes

- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` - Updated navigation and error handling
- `frontend/lib/utils.ts` - Added browser detection utilities
- `frontend/next.config.mjs` - Added security headers
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Added meta tags and notice component

### New Components

- `frontend/components/BraveBrowserNotice.tsx` - User notification component

### Build Fixes

- `frontend/app/knowledge/page.tsx` - Added Suspense boundary for useSearchParams
- Fixed TypeScript errors and build warnings

## How It Works

### 1. Browser Detection

The application now detects when users are using Brave browser with wallet extensions and provides appropriate guidance.

### 2. Safe Navigation

The `safeNavigate()` function tries multiple navigation methods:

1. Next.js router (preferred)
2. window.location.href (fallback)
3. Programmatic link click (last resort)

### 3. User Guidance

- Yellow notice on login page for Brave users
- Floating notification component
- Clear error messages with actionable advice

## User Instructions

When users encounter navigation issues in Brave browser:

1. **Try Incognito Mode**: Open an incognito/private window
2. **Disable Wallet Extensions**: Temporarily disable MetaMask or other wallet extensions
3. **Use Different Browser**: Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear cookies and cache for the site

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Test login flow in Brave browser with MetaMask enabled
4. Verify navigation works properly after login
5. Check that user notices appear appropriately

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Monitor User Feedback**: Track if users still report navigation issues
2. **Browser Analytics**: Consider adding browser detection analytics
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure the app works without JavaScript for maximum compatibility
4. **Regular Testing**: Test with different wallet extensions and browser versions

## Technical Notes

- The fixes are backward compatible and don't affect other browsers
- All changes are defensive and include fallbacks
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Build process is now clean with no TypeScript errors
